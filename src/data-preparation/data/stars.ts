Ruled by the Rakata from c. 30,000 BBY but the warrior species fled upon the collapse of their empire c. 25,000 BBY. Later it was ruled by a puppet government loyal to the Sith Empire. World was overrun by Praetorite Vong in 25 ABY; its atmosphere was altered due to a Yuuzhan Vong bioweapon in the form of a beetle that produced massive amounts of carbon dioxide and sulfur. The Vong built a shipyard here on their way into the Galaxy."

By this time only one major city remained, and most of the remainder of the surface was covered in wastelands, barren plains and abandoned ruins.

During the Clone Wars, the world was located in Seperatist space; Bastion later became the capital of the Fel Empire, and eventually Roan Fel's Empire-in-exile."

The Erso family settled here to hide out after the rise of the Galactic Empire, until Orson Krennic tracked them down. Lyra Erso was killed, Galen was captured, and a young Jyn hid and was later rescued by Saw Gerrera."

During the Jedi Civil War, the world was conquered and bombed by Revan's Sith Empire. Surviving residents moved into ramshackle tenements or old shipping containers.

Many millennia before the Galactic Civil War, a nearby star called M'dweshuu went supernova, bathing Kintan in radiation. The Nikto evolved into six distinct sub-species in response to this radiation and their local environments. Around 25,130 BBY a violent cult worshiping the supernova came to power, leading to four civil wars. Under the Treaty of Vontor in 25,100 BBY, the Nikto were permanently indentured to the Hutts. Kintan striders, favored pets of the Hutts and the inspiration for one of the pieces in dejarik holochess, were originally from this world, but were eventually driven extinct on Kintan."

Thousands of years before the Galactic Civil War, the world was plagued by frequent groundquakes and tidal waves, leading is native Mrlssi to value knowledge rather than possessions.

Located close to Wild Space, Ryloth served as a key spice production facility, whose inhabitants were exploited as slave labor by the Hutts during the Clone Wars, Ryloth suffered a full planet-wide invasion by the Seperatists but were eventually freed by the efforts of Twi'lek freedom fighters led by General Cham Syndulla, but before long the world was an Imperial protectorate. In 14 BBY, Syndulla carried out a failed assassination attempt against Darths Sidious and Vader. Cham's daughter Hera became a leader in the Rebellion and later an Alliance/New Republic general in her own right."

It was the site of several tibanna gas mining operations, including Cloud City and Tibannopolis. First discovered prior to the Mandalorian Wars, it was auctioned in 3963 and Empress Teta established a small gas mining operation here. It was first colonized in 1989 BBY, and Cloud City was commissioned by Lord Ecclessis Figg c. 400 BBY. During the Imperial Era, Lando Calrissian served as Baron Administrator until Han Solo, Leia Organa, Chewbacca, and C-3PO fled here from Hoth. Darth Vader captured them to lure Luke Skywalker into a trap."

Apparently once part of the Rakata's Infinite Empire, Hoth was well-known by 4000 BBY, and the Republic suffered a major defeat against a Sith fleet in orbit, showering the frozen world in shipwrecks. During the Imperial era, Hoth was occasionally visited by smugglers and pirates, and the Rebel Alliance established Echo Base here in 2 ABY. In 3 ABY the Empire discovered the base, resulting in the Battle of Hoth and the Rebels' desperate scramble to evacuate."

It was polluted by industry and the mining of its chief export, lommite ore, a primary component of transparisteel. During the High Republic era, Eriadu was the site of tragedy during the Great Hyperspace Disaster, when a piece of debris from the freighter Legacy Run struck Eriadu's moon, killing 1.2 billion inhabitants. Eriadu was the homeworld of Imperial Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, formerly lieutenant governor of the planet. After his death in the Battle of Yavin, the Tarkin Memorial Conference Center was built in Eriadu City to honor him."

Rapidly mutating flora and fauna filled its poisoned swamps and jungles. The Bith people became staunch pacifists and retreated to domed cities tucked into the crags of mountain ranges, burrowing deep into the rock and building high within the domes to alleviate their cramped conditions. Offworlders, and even Bith who had grown up elsewhere, found the domed cities to be harsh and depressing. The mutated swamp creature known as the Ghhhk was the model for a dejarik chess-piece."

Regarded as one of the great accomplishments of Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh, Starlight Beacon was also a home to the Jedi, hosting the largest number of Jedi aside from Coruscant at that time, and prominently featured a Jedi temple. The station functioned as an observatory, hospital, market, cultural center, and research center, and military outpost of the Republic. The station's hull was nineteen percent triazurite, which helped to boost the station's tranmission signals."

When Mustafar ended up in a gravimetric tug-of-war between the gas giants Jestefad and Lefrani, its core was superheated and its surface was transformed into a volcanic hellscape. The arthropodal Mustafarians evolved to survive their changed environment. The ancient Sith were drawn here by legends of Lady Corvax's hunt for immortality, and built a temple here. It was later acquired by the Techno Union for mining purposes, and Black Sun's headquarters were located here. The Seperatists built battle droids here, and after Anakin and Obi-Wan's fateful duel, Vader built his personal fortress here."

The deep-space docking facility was defended by perimeter battle stations. The world's government was called the Sluis Van Congregate, and it centered mostly around the management of the shipyards. During the Great Galactic War, the Sluis Van shipyards were destroyed by the Sith. During the Thrawn campaign, the Sluis Van shipyards were the site of a battle between Thrawn's forces and the New Republic, and although the Grand Admiral failed to capture any ships during the raid, he did manage to knock out more than 40 vessels' control systems."

Though it was located near the Rimma Trade Route (one of the galaxy's largest hyperlanes), Dagobah itself was only accessible by obscure hyperroutes. A humid, swampy world enshrouded in thick mists that could make navigation difficult, it was home to a host of wildlife including bogwings, dragonsnakes, swamp slugs, and sleen. It rarely appeared on astrography charts and was re-scouted several times. In 39 BBY the first official Republic survey ended in disaster when Alderaanian scouts were devoured by wildlife. A stranded pre-Clone Wars expedition resorted to cannibalism."

THere was little surface water, but a vast, subterranean ocean encircled the world just below the upper crust. Due to the lack of large trees, Utapauan architecture made extensive use of large animal bones. The world attempted to remain neutral during most galacic conflicts. Two sentient species, the slender and tall Pau'ans, and the short and stubby Utai, called the world home. Obi-Wan Kenobi confronted General Grievous on Utapau and slew him after a protracted duel just before the execution of Order 66. Kenobi escaped, but many locals were transported to Byss, where they were used as slaves in ''recolonization efforts.''"

The tribes of Talz inhabiting Orto Plutonia were granted independence following a short conflict with the Pantorans during the Clone Wars. Pantora was a member of the Republic, represented by Riyo Chuchi in the Senate. In 21 BBY the moon was blockaded by the Trade Federation, who falsely claimed that Pantora owed them substantial debts, hoping to force them to join the Seperatists. Just after the declaration of the Galactic Empore, Clone Force 99 stopped here to refuel. Bounty hunter Fennec Shand pursued them before they managed to escape offworld."
